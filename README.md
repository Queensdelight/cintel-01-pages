# GitHub Pages: Publish a Client-side Website using Markdown files
This guide shows how to publish a website using GitHub Pages, using Markdown files. 
It's a straightforward way to share your projects or portfolio online.

## Step 1: Create a New Repository

1. **Log in** to GitHub and navigate to your repositories.
2. Click the **New** button to create a new repository.
3. **Name** your repository (e.g. cintel-01-pages).
4. Important: **Initialize** the repository with a default README.md (always!)

## Step 2: Prepare Your Website
1. In your repository, click the **Add file** button and select **Create new file**.
2. Name your mew file `index.md` (this is the file extension for a Markdown file).
3. **Copy** the content below into `index.md`. 
4. **Commit** the file.

```markdown
# My Website
```
## Step 3: Enable GitHub Pages

1. Go to your repository's **Settings**.
2. Scroll down to the **Pages** section on the left hand side. 
3. **Source**: Select the branch you want to publish (the branch name should be `main`).
4. **Folder**: Choose the root folder, later, this could be changed to the docs folder, depending on where your files are.
5. Click **Save**, and wait patiently. GitHub will automatically generate a URL (web location) for your site at the top of the Settings / Pages section.

## Step 4: Optional: Customize Your Website

- **Theme**: In the GitHub Pages section, you can select a theme for your website by clicking **Choose a theme**.

## Step 5: Visit Your New Website

- After enabling GitHub Pages and choosing a theme (if desired), use your browser to visit the URL provided and see your new website.

## Additional Tips

- **Update Frequently**: You can update your website by editing the `index.md` file directly on GitHub.
- **Feedback**: Share your website with peers for feedback and make improvements as needed.
